The requirements are as follows:
- People with a gender of "female" should have background-color lightpink
- People with gender of "male" should have background-color lightblue.
- Each box should contain the personâ€™s name
- The component should be able to consume any family tree, not just the one provided.

-First three requirements are front end handled by dtree https://github.com/ErikGartner/dTree
-The final requirement is ambigious "any family tree" but we will assume it is any family tree formatted like the test data

Extra info
- If children = then marriage
- If both married people no parents then root. 
- If one married person with no parent then they in law.(not sure if this needed)
